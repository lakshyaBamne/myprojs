# Demo Projects

This repository contains demo projects primarily for my own reference and help.

### Demo-1 Basic CMake Setup

The most basic cmake project which contains a minimal hello world c++ program.

### Demo-2 Fetching SFML using CMake

The most basic way to use SFML into your project. This program is a simple one to just open a window.
